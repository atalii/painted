# painted
plain text notification daemon

## Overview
painted is a dead simple notification daemon: it reads commands from a file
(which may be a UNIX socket [not yet] for IPC or any text file (including stdin)
for simplicity), notifications from dbus, and writes output to a given file
(usually stdout). It aims to be a UNIX-ish replacement for standard notification
daemons, primarily for bars.

Despite the name (a rough contraction of the initialism PTND, for Plain Text
Notification Daemon), the scope of PTND is not limited to plain text: planned
features include actions, sounds, and more. The goal is to achieve 'minimalism'
through an unrestrictive design that facilitates scripting, run-time
modification, and, of course, completeness.

## Usage

### In General
With no other notification daemons running, run the server (with the command
`painted`). If you send a notification with `notify-send`, you should see it
show up in the terminal window where you've run painted.

With no arguments, painted defaults to reading input commands from stdin.
Available commands (those currently implemented shown checked) are:

-   [ ] help (list commands)
-   [x] clear (put a blank line to make the \'last\' notification empty)
-   [ ] prev (show the previous notification)
-   [ ] next (show the next notification)
-   [ ] action \<N> (select the n\'th action)
-   [x] exit (close the server)

These may be shortened to their first letter. If you'd prefer painted to read
commands over IPC, the same commands are available (not yet). painted does not
come with a client, and in the interest of simplicity and scripting, you should
use netcat or similar to write to the socket.

### In Polybar
Polybar provides the script input, where a running command's stdout will be
displayed as text. You can define a module with the following options, and
invoke it in a bar definition:

```ini
[module/painted]
type = custom/script
exec = "painted --input /tmp/painted.sock"
tail = true # don't wait for painted to finish before displaying content.
on-click = "echo 'clear' >> /tmp/painted.sock"
```

### Somewhere else?

If you have a specific bar or application that would benefit from unique
usage instructions, open an issue and ask for them, or write it out
yourself and submit a pull request!

# Roadmap

There aren\'t any super specific goals for this project: I personally
don\'t need much out of a notification daemon, so if you need something
this doesn\'t have, go ahead and open an issue or implement it yourself
and send a PR. Just note that it *is* plain text, so it won\'t ever
support things like images or formatting.
