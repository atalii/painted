# painted
plain text notification daemon

## Overview
painted is a dead simple notification daemon: it reads commands from a file
(which may be a UNIX socket for IPC or any text file such as stdin for
simplicity), notifications from dbus, and writes output to a given file (usually
stdout). It aims to be a UNIX-ish replacement for standard notification daemons,
primarily for usage with bars.

Despite the name (a rough contraction of the initialism PTND, for Plain Text
Notification Daemon), the scope of Painted is not limited to plain text: planned
features include actions, sounds, and more. The goal is to achieve 'minimalism'
through an unrestrictive design that facilitates scripting, run-time
modification, and, of course, completeness.

## Building

Build with a Go compiler of at least 1.17: `go build ./cmd/painted`.

Tagged versions can be built with Nix Flakes: `git checkout v0.1.3 && nix build`.

The Nix build is currently broken on the primary dev branch. I'll fix it...
eventually.

## Usage
See painted(1). (If you've just got the source checked out, you can run `man
./painted.1` to view the equivalent man page.)

### Some Specific Config Files
Check the contrib/ folder for some config files that invoke painted in a way
that makes sense. Note that the contrib directory isn't super well-maintained,
and just exists as a dumping ground for stuff that you may or may not want to
use[^1].

## Roadmap and TODOs
This isn't supposed to be one of those highly minimal UNIX utilities, but it's
also not supposed to be massive. That said, here's what I'm currently wanting to
implement:

- Basic:
  - [x] Actually record notifications (obviously)
  - [x] Notification history and navigation
  - [x] persistence
  - [x] Command matching by prefix (i.e., only `pr` to activate `previous` so
        long as no other command begins with `pr`)
  - [x] notification format strings
  - [x] body text
- Additional (everything necessary for a 1.0.0):
  - [ ] Actions
  - [ ] Docs
  - [x] Man page packaged in Nix.
- Unneeded, but nice:
  - [ ] Do not disturb mode
  - [ ] Sounds

## Releases and Changelog
Painted roughly follows SemVer. Changes are documented in annotated git tags. To
view the release notes for a given release, run `git show v[release-number]`,
for example, `git show v0.1.0`.
